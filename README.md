# weather-app

You want to know the weather forecast for the coming week ? I have just the right app for you !
[HERE](https://justinehell-weather-app.netlify.app/)

This is a simple app made with Vue.js and [OpenweatherMap API](openweathermap.org).
I had fun while building this app and I will continue to learn Vue with this project.

## Next features that I will be working on : 
- Show the weather details for a particular day after a click on that day's thumbnail
- Add cool animations and effects
- Search Bar to find the weather in the location of your choice
- A graph that will show the evolution of the temperature (every 3 hours)
